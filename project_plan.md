# Introduction

## Repository structure
The repository will follow the [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model. The model was chosen since the project members felt like it would be the most 'fun' to work with.

GitHub pull requests will be used, even though there is only one project member. This will be done, beacause __the__ member has not previously worked with pull request and it was thought that it was time to learn to work with them.
